# 7segment_driver
A small board to drive the LTC-4627 & LTC-2623 4x7-segments ICs.

## Warning
This board is a work in progress, therefore it might not work properly. No board has been produced yet. Use at your own risk.

## Description
This board was adapted from [Sparkfun's 7-Segment Serial Display](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11441) (licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) to work with both the LTC-4627 and LTC-2623 4x7-segments ICs from LiteOn.

To drive the 7-segments IC, it uses an ATmega328.
Left-over GPIOs are broken out on a connector (to be used as input, for example).
